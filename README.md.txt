# Case Study: Gender Equality Employment 

### In this project, 
Is Analysis for Case study using Excel and MySQL to deliver the requested results.

### The Case Study:
- A company wants to assess its gender equality employment policy by looking into the number of male and female employees in the company. 
- This analysis is assumed to be done on this date: December 31, 2000.
- I used the employees.sql file found in this folder to create a database and perform an analysis.

### Answer the following questions:
•	The number of male and female employees in the company. 
•	The ratio of males to females hired in the last 5 years. 
•	If the ratio is not 1:1, list the departments that have the highest gaps in descending order. 
•	If the ratio is not 1:1, then design a 5-year plan to resolve this difference when hiring new employees to fill new positions. Clearly state the number of employees we need to hire each year. 
•	If the average salary for males and females is not equal, then find the gap in each department and design a 5-year plan to resolve this situation. Clearly state the number of additional funds that the company needs to allocate.
